print( "How about some more.")

# True or False: Is 5 greater than -2?
print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2) # This will print( True
#True or False: Is 5 greater or equal to -2? 
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2) # This will also print( True
# True or false: Is 5 less than or equal to -2?
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2) # This will print( False, because it is a negative number.

# 4: Research a "floating point" number.
# Basically it is a way for Python to take an extremely long number (0.1024382382837547347374) and rounds it off to be more human readable.
# From Python.org: ...more digits than most people find useful, so Python keeps the number of digits manageable by displaying a rounded value instead
